 🛡️ Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. With the increasing volume of online transactions, fraud detection systems are crucial in identifying suspicious activities and preventing financial losses

🧠 Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that accurately identifies fraudulent transactions. This involves:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and evaluation using various ML algorithms
- Handling class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE, undersampling, or oversampling
- Deployment-ready pipeline (optional)

  📂 Dataset

- **Name**: [Insert Dataset Name Here]
- **Source**: [Kaggle / UCI / Proprietary / etc.]
- **Description**: [A brief description of what the dataset contains]
- **Imbalance**: Yes, the dataset is highly imbalanced with a small percentage of fraudulent transactions.

> Example: The dataset contains credit card transactions with features transformed using PCA due to confidentiality reasons. It includes 284,807 transactions, out of which only 492 are fraudulent.

🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Imbalanced-learn (for SMOTE)
- XGBoost / Random Forest / Logistic Regression
